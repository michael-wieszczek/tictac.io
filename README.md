<h1> Tictac-io</h1> 
<h3> About: </h3> 
 <p>Tictac-io is an online multiplayer variation of the classic tictactoe game. It is played on a randomized 10x10 board with certain spots being blocked off, indicated by a black square. 2 players then take turns filling up the board with their corresponding shapes. The game ends once all spaces are filled and the winner is determined by calculating who has the most 3-in-a-rows on the board. </p> </h3>

 <h3> Rules: </h3>
 <p>- 2 Players are required to start the game. <br>
  - Once the game begins, both players race to be the first one to pick their starting position. <br>
- Players take turns placing down their corresponding symbol on open squares. <br>
- Upon having 3 of the players symbols in a diagonal, horizontal or vertical row, that player will be rewarded 1 point. <br>
- Black squares serve as obstacles and do not count for scoring. <br>
- Once all open tiles are filled, the scores will be added up and the player with the most points will be the winner</p>
 <h3> Technical Analysis: </h3>
 <p> This project was built primarily using Javascript for the calculations and the game logic and HTML/CSS for the front end visuals, Node.js and Socket.io were used to setup client/server communication to allow for online multiplayer which is currently being hosted on Heroku. The link for the game can be found above. </p>
 <h3> Future Plans: </h3>
 <p> - Allow setting up private games <br>
  - 3 and 4 player support <br>
  - Optional AI to play against <br>
  - Imporved UI to select player count <br>
  - More gamemode variations
